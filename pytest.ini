# Configuration for ColliderML tests
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests that require network access and real data (deselect with '-m "not integration"')

# Note: If you have ROS pytest plugins installed that cause conflicts,
# run pytest with: PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 pytest ...
# With that set, add -p pytest_cov if you need coverage (e.g. --cov=colliderml).
